## [CHAPTER 1: Overview] (~40 seconds)

We have a problem:

Token launches are a mess. Platforms like pump.fun flood the market with thousands of low-effort memecoins daily. No quality filter, no accountability – just endless rugs. And traditional presales? Projects raise millions, dump on investors, and vanish.

I have a solution: Banana Fun.

And Banana Fun takes a different approach. By combining NFTs with token launches, you can actually see what you're investing in. Quality art signals a quality project. No more anonymous tokens with zero effort behind them. Plus, NFTs naturally build community – holders share a visual identity and become invested in the project's success.

Here's how it works: You mint NFTs from a collection – each one entitles you to a share of the project's token. When the sale completes, liquidity is automatically created on a DEX. Then you claim your vested tokens over time.

In short: Banana Fun synchronizes community, tokens, and liquidity through smart contract logic – with built-in investor protection.

## [CHAPTER 2: Mint (Video keyframe ~0:14)] (~30 seconds)

Let's see it in action. Here's a live NFT collection on Banana Fun.

You can see the minting progress. The interface shows you everything upfront: the token symbol, sale deadline, and importantly – the vesting schedule for both NFT holders and the team.

Multiple mint stages support different pricing tiers. There's whitelist protection for early supporters, and public sales for everyone else. Just select how many NFTs you want, click mint, and you're in.

## [CHAPTER 3: Failed Launch (Video keyframe ~2:36)] (~25 seconds)

But what if a launch doesn't reach its target?

If the deadline passes and the collection isn't sold out, the launch is marked as failed. But you're not stuck – you can burn your NFTs and get a full refund.

The refund interface shows exactly how much you'll get back. Click "Burn & Refund" and your investment returns safely to your wallet.

## [CHAPTER 4: Successful Launch (Video keyframe ~0:55)] (~35 seconds)

Now the exciting part – what happens when a launch succeeds?

When all NFTs sell out, the magic happens automatically. The smart contract mints the total token supply, creates a liquidity pool on Yuzu DEX, and initializes vesting for both NFT holders and the team.

Look at this completed collection – 20 out of 20 minted. The token is live, trading has begun, and NFT holders can now claim their vested tokens.

Here you can see my three NFTs, each with over 50 million tokens allocated. I can claim what's vested at any time, with tokens unlocking linearly over the vesting period.

## [CHAPTER 5: Trade on Yuzu DEX (Video keyframe ~1:26)] (~20 seconds)

And because liquidity was created automatically, the token is immediately tradeable on Yuzu DEX.

No waiting for the team to add liquidity. No hoping they don't rug. It's all handled by the smart contract. Swap your tokens whenever you want – the market is live from day one.

## [CHAPTER 6: Team Vesting (Video keyframe ~2:04)] (~20 seconds)

Finally, teams also vest their tokens through the same transparent system. You can see exactly when the team's tokens unlock, how much they've claimed, and how much remains.

This alignment ensures everyone – holders and creators – succeeds together.

## [CLOSING] (~10 seconds)

Banana Fun. Safe launches. Instant liquidity. Fair distribution. The way token launches should be.

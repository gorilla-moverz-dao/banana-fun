## CHAPTER 1 TO BE REFINED: Overview (~40 seconds)

The Problem:

Launching a token in crypto is broken. Projects raise millions through presales, dump on investors, and disappear. Buyers have no protection, and communities are left holding worthless bags.

The Solution:

Banana Fun fixes this with a fundamentally different approach. It's an NFT-backed token launchpad where your investment is protected by design.

Here's how it works in three simple steps: First, you mint NFTs from a collection. Each NFT entitles you to a share of the project's token. Second, when the sale completes, liquidity is automatically created on a decentralized exchange. Third, you claim your vested tokens over time. More NFTs means more tokens.

Why is this better? Safe launches with built-in refunds if targets aren't met. Instant NFT reveals so you know what you're getting. Automatic liquidity creation. And fair vesting that prevents early dumping and stabilizes the token price.

## [CHAPTER 2: Mint (Video keyframe ~0:14)] (~30 seconds)

Let's see it in action. Here's a live NFT collection on Banana Fun.

You can see the minting progress. The interface shows you everything upfront: the token symbol, sale deadline, and importantly – the vesting schedule for both NFT holders and the team.

Multiple mint stages support different pricing tiers. There's whitelist protection for early supporters, and public sales for everyone else. Just select how many NFTs you want, click mint, and you're in.

## [CHAPTER 3: Failed Launch (Video keyframe ~2:36)] (~25 seconds)

But what if a launch doesn't reach its target?

If the deadline passes and the collection isn't sold out, the launch is marked as failed. But you're not stuck – you can burn your NFTs and get a full refund.

The refund interface shows exactly how much you'll get back. Click "Burn & Refund" and your investment returns safely to your wallet.

## [CHAPTER 4: Successful Launch (Video keyframe ~0:55)] (~35 seconds)

Now the exciting part – what happens when a launch succeeds?

When all NFTs sell out, the magic happens automatically. The smart contract mints the total token supply, creates a liquidity pool on Yuzu DEX, and initializes vesting for both NFT holders and the team.

Look at this completed collection – 20 out of 20 minted. The token is live, trading has begun, and NFT holders can now claim their vested tokens.

Here you can see my three NFTs, each with over 50 million tokens allocated. I can claim what's vested at any time, with tokens unlocking linearly over the vesting period.

## [CHAPTER 5: Trade on Yuzu DEX (Video keyframe ~1:26)] (~20 seconds)

And because liquidity was created automatically, the token is immediately tradeable on Yuzu DEX.

No waiting for the team to add liquidity. No hoping they don't rug. It's all handled by the smart contract. Swap your tokens whenever you want – the market is live from day one.

## [CHAPTER 6: Team Vesting (Video keyframe ~2:04)] (~20 seconds)

Finally, teams also vest their tokens through the same transparent system. You can see exactly when the team's tokens unlock, how much they've claimed, and how much remains.

This alignment ensures everyone – holders and creators – succeeds together.

## [CLOSING] (~10 seconds)

Banana Fun. Safe launches. Instant liquidity. Fair distribution. The way token launches should be.
